Definition: 
An array is a linear data structure and it is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. 
The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. It allows the processing of a large amount 
of data in a relatively short period. It stores multiple data of the same type at one time. The first element 
of the array is indexed by a subscript of 0. There are different operations possible in Array like Searching, Sorting, 
Inserting, Traversing, Reversing, and Deleting.

Characteristics of an Array: 
An array has various different characteristics which is as follows:

1.Arrays uses an index-based data structure which helps to identify each of the elements in an array easily using the index.
2.If user want to store multiple values of same data type then array can be and utilized efficiently.
3.Array can also handle complex data structure by storing data in two dimensional array.
4.Array is also used to  Implement other data structures like Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Hash tables, etc.
5.The search process in array can be done very easily.
6.In array accessing an element is very easy by using the index number.

Applications of Array: 
Different applications of Array is as follow:

1.Array is used in solving matrices problem
2.Databases record are also implemented by array.
3.It helps in implementing sorting algorithm.
4.It is also used to  Implement other data structures like Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Hash tables, etc.
5.Array can be used for CPU scheduling.
6.Applied as lookup table in computer.
7.Arrays can be used in speech processing, where every speech signal is an array.

Types of Arrays in C#:
There are 3 types of arrays in C# programming:

1.Single Dimensional Array => int[] arr = new int[5]{ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };  

2.Multidimensional Array => int[,] arr = new int[,]{ { 1, 2, 3 }, { 4, 5, 6 }, { 7, 8, 9 } };  

3.Jagged Array => int[][] arr = new int[3][]{  
                                    new int[] { 11, 21, 56, 78 },  
                                    new int[] { 2, 5, 6, 7, 98, 5 },  
                                    new int[] { 2, 5 }  
                                    };

C# Array class :

C# provides an Array class to deal with array related operations. It provides methods for creating, manipulating, searching, 
and sorting elements of an array. This class works as the base class for all arrays in the .NET programming environment.
