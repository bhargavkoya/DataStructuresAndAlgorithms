Definion1:
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

Definition2: 
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so 
that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. A data structure is not only used for organizing the data it is also used for 
processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost 
every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures. 

Types:

1.Linear data structure: 
Data structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where each and every element is attached to its previous and 
next adjacent is called a linear data structure. 
Examples of linear data structure are array, stack, queue, linked list etc.
   1.Static data structure: Static Data structure has fixed memory size. It is more easier to access the element in static data structure. 
     Examples of this data structure is array.
   2.Dynamic data structure: In Dynamic Data Structure the size is not fixed, the size can be randomly updated during run time which may be considered efficient with respect to memory complexity of the code. 
     Examples of this data structure is queue, stack, etc.

2.Non-linear data structure: 
Data structure where data elements are not sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In non-linear data structure 
we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in single run only. 
Examples of non-linear data structure are trees and graphs.

In C#:
Array,ArrayList[dynamic array],LinkedList,Stack,Queue,Dictionary,HashTable,SortedDictionary,StringDictionary,HashSet,SortedSet.

Operations on DS:
Insertion,Deletion,Traversal,Searching,Sorting,Access.
